<!-- Question 1
What is the value of clothes[0] and why?
const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;
console.log(clothes[0]); -->

<!-- The value of clothes[0] is undefined because when we do not consider clothes.length = 0; then clothes[0]=jacket as it is
an array but here clothes.length=0 will give you 0 which is integer so it will print undefined -->
